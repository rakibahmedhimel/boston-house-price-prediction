# 🏠 Boston House Price Prediction

This project uses the Boston Housing dataset to predict house prices using **Linear Regression**.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Select meaningful features
- Train and evaluate a linear regression model
- Understand residuals and model performance

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Key Results
- Achieved Mean Squared Error (MSE): **46.14**
- RMSE ≈ **6.7**, meaning predictions are off by 6.7 units on average

## 📎 How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `boston_house_price_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter

## 🤖 Future Plans
- Try more advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost)
- Deploy the model as a web app using **Streamlit or FastAPI**
